        <h3>The story</h3>

        <br><p class="first"> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p>
        
        <br><q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> 
        
        <br><p>The farmer said, </p> 
        
        <br><strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> 
        
        <br><p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p>
        
        <br><q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> 
        
        <br> <p>The farmer again said,</p> 
        
        <br><strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong>
        
        <br><p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p>
            
        <br><q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q> 
        
        <br><p>and the farmer responded, </p>
        
        <br><strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> 
        
        <br><p> On the next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, </p>
        
        <br><q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> 
        
        <br><p>Again, he said, </p>
        
        <br><strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong>
        
        <br><blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span>fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
